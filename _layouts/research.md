## Current research (my PhD work)

### A Systems Framework For Rapid Conceptual Design of Aerocapture Missions

The basic purpose of the thesis work is to provide a systems engineering framework for rapid aerocapture mission formulation, starting from a high-level mission objective(s) to a viable mission concept. The mission designer has to select a mutually compatible, harmonious set of systems that when tied together, will accomplish the stated objective(s) within the technical, cost, schedule, and risk constraints. A key element in the system engineering process is the ability of the mission designer to perform trade space exploration, and trade studies to understand the extent of the design space and to understand what combination of systems work together (or not). During the concept exploration phase, it is important to retain as wide a selection of options as possible for each of the system variables. Once the feasibility assessment phase is complete, a baseline reference design is selected from the trade space, as analyzing every possible design combination in further  detail is in most cases not possible. The next step is performance evaluation, where in more detailed calculations are performed to assess the viability and performance metrics of the reference design. If the performance is satisfactory with respect to the mission objectives set out initially, and is feasible from other perspectives (technical, risk etc.) the reference design can be used as a starting point for higher-fidelity studies leading to mission implementation. If the performance metrics are not satisfactory, a different baseline design may be selected, or the mission objective may need to be revised.
