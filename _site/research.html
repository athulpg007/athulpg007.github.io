<p>Schematic showing the various phases of the aerocapture. Atmospheric height is greatly exaggerated for clarity.</p>

<p>The basic objective of this work is to provide a systems engineering framework for rapid aerocapture mission formulation, starting from a high-level mission objective(s) to a viable mission concept. The mission designer has to select a mutually compatible, harmonious set of interconnected systems, which will accomplish the stated objective(s) within the technical, cost, schedule, and risk constraints. For more details, please see my <a href="https://hammer.purdue.edu/articles/thesis/A_Systems_Framework_and_Analysis_Tool_for_Rapid_Conceptual_Design_of_Aerocapture_Missions/14903349">Ph.D. Dissertation</a>. An article is currently under publication in the <em>Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets</em>.</p>

<h3 id="neptune-aerocapture-using-heritage-blunt-body-aeroshells">Neptune Aerocapture Using Heritage Blunt-Body Aeroshells</h3>

<p>The lack of a heritage mid-L/D aeroshell presents a major hurdle for Neptune aerocapture, as the development a new entry vehicle incurs significant time and investment. Techniques which may allow Neptune aerocapture to be feasible using heritage low-L/D blunt-body aeroshells are investigated that obviate the need for mid-L/D aeroshells. For more details, please see the <a href="./papers/1.a34719.pdf">article</a> published <em>Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets</em>, (2020).</p>

<h3 id="feasibility-assessment-of-aerocapture-for-venus-missions">Feasibility Assessment of Aerocapture for Venus Missions</h3>

<p>A numerical assessment of the feasibility of aerocapture at Venus is presented, and the mass benefit of aerocapture is compared with propulsive orbit insertion. This study considers constraints imposed by entry corridor, deceleration loads, and aerodynamic heating on aerocapture for two vehicle control techniques: lift modulation and drag modulation. Feasibility charts are presented to graphically visualize the aerocapture design space spanning
interplanetary trajectory and vehicle performance. For more details, please see the <a href="./papers/1.a34529.pdf">article</a> published <em>Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets</em> (2020).</p>
