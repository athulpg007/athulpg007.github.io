# About Me

## Welcome!

My name is Athul and I am currently a 4th year (as of Spring 2020) graduate student in the [School of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE). I am working towards a PhD in Astrodynamics and Space Applications with a minor in Aerospace Systems. Prior to starting my PhD in 2016, I attended the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras for my undergraduate degree in aerospace engineering where I graduated with high honors. I am a citizen of the Republic of India.

I am interested in advanced mission concepts and technology for planetary exploration. My primary research focus is on mission design and analysis of aerocapture concepts. I have expertise in the general areas of space mission architecture and formulation, systems engineering, Entry Descent and Landing (EDL) system, and design of planetary probes. Although my doctoral research deals exclusively with aerocapture, I have worked on other technologies such as robotic surface mobility systems, sample return mission architectures, and ice giant mission concept studies. I also have expertise in mechanical design and fabrication of test equipment, scientific programming, data analysis and technical writing. You can read more about my research in [Research](https://athulpg007.github.io/research.html) and [Publications/CV](https://athulpg007.github.io/publications_cv.html) tabs!
