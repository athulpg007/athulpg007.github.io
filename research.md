I provide a brief summary of my research here, with the projects listed in reverse chronological order. Click on the project title to learn more about each project (coming soon).

## Current research (my PhD work)

### A Systems Framework For Rapid Conceptual Design of Aerocapture Missions

The basic purpose of this work is to provide a systems engineering framework for rapid aerocapture mission formulation, starting from a high-level mission objective(s) to a viable mission concept. The mission designer has to select a mutually compatible, harmonious set of interconnected systems, which will accomplish the stated objective(s) within the technical, cost, schedule, and risk constraints.

### Purdue Single-Wheel Test Rig for Ocean World Rovers

The NASA COLDTech effort focuses on design and construction of a single-wheel test rig for planetary exploration rovers on ocean worlds such as Europa.

## Past research

### Neptune Aerocapture Using Heritage Blunt-Body Aeroshells

The lack of a heritage mid-L/D aeroshell presents a major hurdle for Neptune aerocapture, as the development a new entry vehicle incurs significant time and investment. Techniques which may allow Neptune aerocapture to be feasible using heritage low-L/D blunt-body aeroshells are investigated that obviate the need for mid-L/D aeroshells.

### Feasibility Assessment of Aerocapture for Venus Missions

A numerical assessment of the feasibility of aerocapture at Venus is presented, and the mass benefit of aerocapture is compared with propulsive orbit insertion. This study considers constraints imposed by entry corridor, deceleration loads, and aerodynamic heating on aerocapture for two vehicle control techniques: lift modulation and drag modulation. Feasibility charts are presented to graphically visualize the aerocapture design space spanning
interplanetary trajectory and vehicle performance.
