# Software and Tutorials

I provide here a brief summary of software I have developed and some programming tutorials. I know I will need to do these agaain at some point in the future, so I decided to document them here so it helps other who run into the same problems as well.

# Aerocapture Mission Analysis Tool (AMAT)

**AMAT** is an open source collection of Python subroutines for mission design and analysis
of aerocapture mission concepts.

AMAT comes with a suite of tools to allow end-to-end conceptual design of aerocapture missions: launch vehicle performance calculator, extensive database of interplanetary trajectories, atmosphere models, guidance schemes, and aeroheating models. AMAT supports analysis for Venus, Earth, Mars, Titan, Uranus, and Neptune for both lift and drag modulation control techniques.

AMAT has been extensively used in various aerocapture mission studies at the [Advanced Astrodynamics Concepts (AAC)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAC/) research group at Purdue University in active collaboration with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). 

To learn more about getting started with AMAT and installation instructions, please refer to the [AMAT documentation](https://amat.readthedocs.io). The stable version of the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/athulpg007/AMAT).
